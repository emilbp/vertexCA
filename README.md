# vertexCA: Vertex Component Analysis in R

The vertexCA package for R will implement the Vertex Component Analysis (VCA) algorithm developed by Nascimento and Dias [(IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens, 43, 2005, pp. 898-910)](http://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.844293).

The goal is to implement it in C++ using RcppArmadillo, but initial work will be put into making a working vca() function in R.
